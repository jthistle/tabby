It's early days. Functionality is limited and contributions aren't really possible at this stage.

## Features

- easy to use 2D-cursor system to allow quick tab editing
- layout system to rearrange music to fit in the best possible way
- powerful vim-like command system

## Installation

Availability on pip / debian / ubuntu may or may not happen, depending on how far this project gets.
