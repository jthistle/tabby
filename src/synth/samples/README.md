# Synth samples

Download samples from [this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EB9Fdef54if3pxkKqq5zDRPek1O8WxM0?usp=sharing).

Unzip if necessary and move the contents to this folder.

You should be left with, in this directory, folders such as `electric_clean`.

This is to prevent storing large wav files within the git repo, which can make it grow unnecessarily.
